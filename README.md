# led-fire-place
Python scripts used to generate LED intensity data sequences to mimic fireplace video.

Used these scripts to generate data for an LED display that mimics an indoor fire.

## Steps

### 1. Build LED display

### 2. Switch each LED on separately in a sequence and film it with a smartphone video camera

### 3. Load video file and select a frame to represent the effect of each LED

See this Jupyter notebook:

### 4. Download a video from YouTube of a real fire in a fireplace and extract image frames

### 5. Compute LED intensities to mimic the real fire video
